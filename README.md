digipark-asm
============

Example assembly code and build environment for [Digispark][ds], a cheap and
tiny [ATtiny85][t85] USB board running the [micronucleus][mn] [V-USB][vusb]
bootloader.

The build process requires [avr-gcc][avrgcc] which is available via the
[larsimmisch/homebrew-avr][avrgcctap] [Homebrew][brew] tap.

Aside from the raw machine code generated by the assembly file, the hex
file uploaded to the AVR via micronucleus needs a vector table, and
some AVR-specific setup code. This is provided by avr-gcc via the
`-mmcu=attiny85` flag. That took me some time to figure out.
